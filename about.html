				coach other individuals in the path of entrepreneurship which can create a ripple effect and make the
				results of the project last for decades.

			<p class="sample-text">
				Through "24/7 Entrepreneurship", young people will benefit from the combination of the knowledge of
				universities, the experience of NGOs, and mentors and trainers with experience and knowledge in
				establishing and sustaining new businesses. The focus on social entrepreneurship will also motivate
				young people to think not only about their own employability in creating their businesses, but also on
				how they can be relevant to society and provide employability opportunities to their peers as well,
				creating a ripple effect of entrepreneurship and employability. They will also be trained as
				entrepreneurship educators themselves, so that their influence can extent beyond themselves and their
				own businesses but also into each of their societies and countries.
				The overall aim of the project is in accordance with one of the primary objectives for K2 Strategic
				Partnerships for Youth:
				- Promoting entrepreneurship education and social entrepreneurship among young people
